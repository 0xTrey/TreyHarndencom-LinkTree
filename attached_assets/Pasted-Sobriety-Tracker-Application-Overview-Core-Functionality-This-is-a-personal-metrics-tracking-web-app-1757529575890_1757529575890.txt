Sobriety Tracker Application Overview
Core Functionality
This is a personal metrics tracking web application that displays real-time day counters for life milestones and sobriety achievements. It automatically calculates and updates three key metrics:

Days of Life: Total days since birth (October 1, 1995)
Days Alcohol Free: Days since quitting alcohol (January 21, 2023)
Days Marijuana Free: Days since quitting marijuana (June 24, 2025)
Technical Architecture
Backend (Flask/Python):

Simple Flask app with single route serving the main page
Minimal MVC structure - just renders the HTML template
Runs on port 5000 with debug mode enabled
Entry point: main.py imports and runs the Flask app from app.py
Frontend (Vanilla JavaScript):

MetricCounter Class: Core JavaScript class that handles:
Date calculations (days between start date and current date)
DOM element updates with visual feedback
Automatic refresh logic
Update System:
Updates every minute via setInterval
Smart midnight scheduling for accurate daily transitions
Handles browser visibility changes (updates when tab becomes active)
Visual pulse animation when counters change
UI/UX Features:

Clean, modern design with gradient backgrounds for each metric
Responsive grid layout (stacks on mobile, 3-column on desktop)
Hover effects and smooth animations
Color-coded metrics (sunrise colors for life, blue for alcohol, green for marijuana)
Mobile-optimized with special handling for Samsung Galaxy S24
