Role
You are a senior frontend engineer. Your job is to refactor treyharnden.com from a single link-tree page into a small multi-page personal website while preserving the current visual style. Keep changes minimal but make the structure real.

High-level goals
1) Add a top navigation bar with routes:
   - Home (/)
   - Links (/links)
   - Journal (/journal)
   - Work (/work)
   - Stats (/stats)

2) Preserve the "link tree" experience as /links so it remains the primary shareable page.

3) Add a GitHub button/link in:
   - /links
   - /work
   - /journal (or /personal if you create that)
   Use the same button style as existing buttons.

4) Move the milestone counters off the current single page and into /stats.
   The home page should show either a smaller "snapshot" section or a single CTA that routes to /stats.

5) Keep the design aesthetic consistent with the current page:
   - Same background gradient
   - Same button styles
   - Same spacing and typography
   Do not redesign. Refactor structure.

6) Journal integration: implement a Phase 1 MVP using a Notion embed.
   - Add a simple Journal page that embeds the public Notion page (iframe) if possible.
   - Provide a fallback "Open in Notion" link if embedding is blocked.
   - Add a prominent warning banner if the iframe fails to load (detect via timeout and show fallback link).

7) Phase 2 optional (only if time is reasonable): add Notion API rendering behind a feature flag.
   - If you implement this, do it safely server-side (serverless function or backend route).
   - Never expose Notion API keys in client code.
   - Add env vars for NOTION_TOKEN and NOTION_DATABASE_ID.
   - Render a list of entries with title + date + tags.
   - Clicking an entry opens /journal/:slug (or /journal/:id) page rendered from Notion blocks.
   If this is too much for the current scope, skip it and just set up the embed MVP cleanly.

Technical instructions
A) First inspect the repository:
   - Identify framework (plain HTML, React, Next.js, etc.).
   - Identify routing approach (if none, add the simplest router for the framework).
   - Determine where the current single page is implemented.

B) Implementation details
   - Create a shared Layout component that includes the nav bar and page container.
   - Nav bar requirements:
     - Sticky at top on scroll
     - Shows active state for the current route
     - Mobile responsive (simple hamburger menu acceptable)
   - Add basic SEO:
     - Page titles per route (Home, Links, Journal, Work, Stats)
     - Meta description per route
     - OpenGraph tags for /links at minimum

C) Page content requirements
   - /links:
     - Show the same avatar, name, bio, and button list you have today
     - Add GitHub button
     - Keep "Book a Call" and professional links here if you want link-tree behavior
   - /work:
     - Professional links only (LinkedIn, ABM playbook generator, Book a Call, GitHub)
     - Short paragraph describing what the page is for
   - /journal:
     - Rename "Personal Website" concept to "Public Journal"
     - Embed Notion (Phase 1) plus fallback link
     - Include GitHub button
   - /stats:
     - Move the 3 milestone cards here
     - Add microcopy: "Counts include start day and today"
     - Ensure the displayed start dates match the calculation
     - If inclusive counting is used, make the start date the exact sober date and cannabis date used for the counter
   - /:
     - Simple home page with 2 primary CTAs:
       1) Read the journal (to /journal)
       2) Work (to /work)
     - Optionally include a small stats snapshot row linking to /stats

D) Acceptance criteria
   - All routes render and are reachable from nav
   - /links matches current page functionality and visuals
   - GitHub button exists on /links, /work, /journal
   - Milestones moved to /stats and still work
   - Build passes and deploy is successful
   - No secrets committed (env vars only)

Deliverables
1) Implement the refactor and commit changes.
2) Provide a short README section:
   - How to run locally
   - Where to set env vars if Phase 2 API is implemented
   - How to change link URLs (a single config file preferred)

Start now by:
1) Summarizing the current repo structure and tech stack.
2) Proposing a minimal routing approach.
3) Implementing the new layout + routes.
